# Email Edit Disabled in Profile

## Changes Made
Made the email field non-editable in the profile edit section for security reasons.

## Files Modified
**app/(tabs)/profile.tsx**

### Changes:
1. **Email Input Field** (lines 457-467):
   - Added `editable={false}` property to disable editing
   - Added `style={{ opacity: 0.6 }}` to visually indicate the field is disabled
   - Removed `onChangeText` handler since editing is disabled

2. **Visual Indicator** (lines 465-467):
   - Added explanatory text: "Email cannot be changed for security reasons"
   - Styled with secondary text color to make it subtle but informative

3. **CSS Styles** (lines 1188-1193):
   - Added `emailNote` style for the explanatory text
   - Small font size (12px), italic style
   - Proper spacing with negative top margin and bottom margin
