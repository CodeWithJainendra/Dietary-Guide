# Environment Variable Loading Issue Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified
The error "No auth credentials found" indicates that your OpenRouter API key isn't being loaded from the environment variables properly.

## 🔍 Root Cause
This is a common issue with Expo/React Native where environment variables don't reload properly without a complete restart.

## ✅ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Complete Metro Restart
1. **Stop your current Expo server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Clear Metro cache**:
   ```bash
   npm start -- --clear
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Environment File
Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-v3
```

### Step 3: Test with Debug Button
1. **Restart your app** after clearing cache
2. **Tap the 🧪 Test AI button** on home screen
3. **Check console output** for detailed debugging info

## 🔧 Advanced Debugging

### Check Environment Loading
The test button will now show:
- ✅ Environment variable detection
- ✅ API key format validation
- ✅ Request headers being sent
- ✅ Exact error responses

### Manual Test Fallback
If environment variables still don't work, the test button will:
1. Try environment variable first
2. Fall back to manual test with hardcoded key
3. Show which method works

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Success Output:
```
✅ OpenRouter test successful!
🤖 Response: OpenRouter working!
```

### Environment Issue Output:
```
❌ Environment test failed, trying manual test...
✅ Manual test worked! Check environment variables.
```

## 🛠️ Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Hardcode for Testing
Temporarily hardcode the key in `utils/aiService.ts`:
```typescript
apiKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY || 'sk-or-v1-your-key-here',
```

### Option 2: Use app.config.js
Create `app.config.js` in root:
```javascript
export default {
  expo: {
    // ... other config
    extra: {
      openrouterApiKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    },
  },
};
```

Then access via:
```typescript
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
const apiKey = Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.openrouterApiKey;
```

### Option 3: Check File Location
Ensure `.env` is in the **root directory** (same level as package.json), not in a subfolder.

## 🚀 Most Likely Fix
**Complete Metro restart with cache clear** solves 90% of environment variable issues in Expo.

Run this and test again:
```bash
npm start -- --clear
```

The enhanced test button will tell you exactly what's working and what isn't! 🎯
