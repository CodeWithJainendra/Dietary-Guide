# Profile Image Picker Implementation

## Overview
Implemented complete image picker functionality for changing profile pictures with camera, gallery, and sample avatar options.

## Dependencies Added
- `expo-image-picker` - For camera and gallery access

## Configuration Changes
**app.json**
- Added iOS permissions: `NSCameraUsageDescription`, `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`
- Added Android permissions: `CAMERA`, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- Added `expo-image-picker` plugin with permission descriptions

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Image Picker Options**
- **Take Photo**: Opens camera to capture new profile picture
- **Choose from Library**: Opens photo gallery to select existing image
- **Use Sample Avatar**: Provides random high-quality avatars from Unsplash
- **Remove Photo**: Removes custom profile picture (only shown if user has one)

### 2. **Permission Handling**
- Automatically requests camera and media library permissions
- Shows user-friendly error messages if permissions are denied
- Graceful fallback if permissions are not granted

### 3. **Image Processing**
- Images are cropped to 1:1 aspect ratio (square)
- Quality is optimized to 0.8 for good balance of quality and file size
- Supports editing/cropping before saving

### 4. **Data Persistence**
- Profile images are saved to Supabase database
- Local state is updated immediately for responsive UI
- Zustand store is updated for global state management
- Fallback to default images if no custom image is set

### 5. **Theme Integration**
- Respects dark/light theme for default profile images
- Custom profile images override theme-based defaults
- Smooth transitions between different image states

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
**app/(tabs)/profile.tsx**

### Key Functions Added:
1. **`requestPermissions()`** - Handles camera and media library permissions
2. **`updateProfileImage(imageUri)`** - Updates image in state, store, and database
3. **`openCamera()`** - Launches camera with proper configuration
4. **`openImagePicker()`** - Opens photo gallery with proper configuration
5. **`removeProfileImage()`** - Removes custom profile picture
6. **`handleChangeProfilePicture()`** - Shows options dialog

### Image Configuration:
```javascript
{
  mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
  allowsEditing: true,
  aspect: [1, 1],
  quality: 0.8,
}
```

### Database Integration:
- Updates `profiles` table in Supabase
- Uses `userId` for record identification
- Handles errors gracefully with user feedback

## User Experience

### Visual Indicators:
- Camera icon overlay on profile image
- Responsive feedback during image operations
- Success/error alerts for user feedback

### Accessibility:
- Clear option labels in selection dialog
- Proper error messages for permission issues
- Fallback options if camera/gallery unavailable

## Error Handling
- Permission denied scenarios
- Camera/gallery access failures
- Database update failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid image format handling

## Security Considerations
- Proper permission requests
- Image quality optimization to prevent large uploads
- Secure database updates with user authentication
- Input validation for image URIs

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test camera functionality on physical device
2. Test gallery selection with various image formats
3. Test permission denial scenarios
4. Test network failure during image upload
5. Test theme switching with custom profile images
6. Test image removal functionality
