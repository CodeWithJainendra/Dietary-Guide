# Navigation Error Fix

## Problem
The app was showing this error:
```
The action 'REPLACE' with payload {"name":"(tabs)","params": ("screen":"index","params": {}}} was not handled by any navigator.

Do you have a route named '(tabs)'?
```

## Root Cause
The app had both `@react-navigation/native` and `expo-router` installed, causing a conflict between the two navigation systems. The error message is typical of React Navigation, not Expo Router.

## Solution
1. **Removed conflicting package**: Removed `@react-navigation/native` from package.json
2. **Cleaned dependencies**: Ran `npm install` to ensure clean state
3. **Cleared cache**: Used `npx expo start --clear` to clear Metro bundler cache

## Changes Made
- Removed `"@react-navigation/native": "^7.1.6"` from package.json
- The app now uses only Expo Router for navigation

## Verification
The app should now work without the navigation error. The LogMealForm component and all navigation actions should work properly with Expo Router.

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Removed React Navigation dependency

## Navigation Structure
The app uses Expo Router with this structure:
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Root stack navigator
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Tab navigator
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Home screen with LogMealForm
- `components/LogMealForm.tsx` - Meal logging form (no navigation code)

All navigation is handled through Expo Router's `router` object and the safe navigation utilities in `utils/navigation.ts`.
